# My process
This project being relatively simple, I've decided that the best way to approach it will be with the help of vanilla JS without any frameworks such as React. However, I added TypeScript to ensure consistency and type safety. The project is divided between a base class and a subclass: the base class mainly focuses on grabbing information from the DOM, while the subclass is responsible for calculations and rendering. The intent was to provide flexibility for future potential project expansion.
